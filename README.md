1. Project Overview

The Expense Tracker Application is a Java-based web application developed using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. The primary goal of this application is to allow users to manage their expenses by adding, viewing, and deleting expense records.

2. Technologies Used

Backend: Java, Spring Boot
Database: PostgreSQL
Build Tool: Maven
Version Control: Git
Containerization: Docker (for deployment)
3. Features

Expense Management: Users can view a list of expenses, view detailed information about each expense, add new expenses, and delete existing expenses.
RESTful API: The application exposes RESTful endpoints for interacting with the data.
4. Application Structure

The application follows a typical Spring Boot structure, with separate packages for controllers, services, repositories, and models. The main components include:

ExpenseController: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
ExpenseService: Contains business logic for managing expenses.
ExpenseRepository: Interacts with the PostgreSQL database to perform CRUD operations.
Expense: Represents the expense entity.
5. Database Schema

The database schema includes a single table, expense, with fields for id, description, amount, and date. The schema is defined in the schema.sql file and is automatically created when the application starts.

6. Deployment

The application can be containerized using Docker for easy deployment. A Dockerfile can be created to define the container image, and Docker Compose can be used to manage multi-container deployments if necessary.

7. Future Enhancements

User Authentication and Authorization: Implement a secure authentication system using Spring Security.
Expense Categories: Add support for categorizing expenses for better organization.
Reporting and Analytics: Develop reporting and analytics features to help users gain insights into their spending habits.
Front-end Development: Develop a user-friendly front-end using a framework like React or Angular.
8. Conclusion

The Expense Tracker Application demonstrates the use of Java and Spring Boot to create a robust and scalable web application. With further enhancements and features, it can be developed into a comprehensive expense management tool. The codebase is modular and follows best practices, making it easy to extend and maintain.
